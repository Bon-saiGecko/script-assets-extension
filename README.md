# Script Assets for VS Code

⚠️ Notice: Script Assets for VS Code is currently lacking many of the features that Script Assets includes. 

[Script Assets](https://scriptassets.saige.dev) is a plugin avaliable for Roblox Studio. Script Assets for VS Code brings Script Assets into Visual Studio Code. Developers can hover over `rbxassetid://`s in `.lua` and `.luau` scripts to see a preview of the asset.
